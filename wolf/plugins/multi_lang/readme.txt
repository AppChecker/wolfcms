== WHAT IT IS ==

The multi lang plugin allows you to add translations of your pages.

== HOW TO USE IT ==

* Enable the plugin
* Access the settings page for the plugin and make your choices.

== NOTES ==

* Currently you can only translate the body part of a page by adding a tab or
  page part to the page with the iso 639-1 language code for the language into
  which you are translating the page.

* Currently, the plugin allows you to choose one and only one source for
  determining which language a user prefers.
